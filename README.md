# **Mandelbrot Set Visualization - PyOpenGL**

This project is a revisited of my very first GitHub project: a Python visualization of the Mandelbrot set using numpy that I made in my freshman year of high school. In this updated version, I've speed things up by using PyOpenGL on a GPU to be able to make it not take 5 minutes to render the set.

### **Current Status** 

This project is a work in progress (WIP). While it does visualize the set, there are still some bugs to be squashed once I get more time

### Goals and To-Do List
* Remove weird artifacts and lines
* Upgrade the project to support double-precision 
* Add color customization
